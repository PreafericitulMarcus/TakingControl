# Self Host 
Watching PewDiePie's video inspired me to take the steps in order to take control of my digital footprint.

## Before -> After

GBoard -> Heliboard
WhatsApp -> Signal
Google Tasks -> Super Productivity


## Self Hosting on local server

I use Docker in order to compartmentalize different applications.
